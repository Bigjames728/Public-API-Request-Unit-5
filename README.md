# Public API Request Unit 6
This app allows you to generate 12 random employees and dynamically display their picture, name, email and location on the web page. You are then able to click on a specific employee to 
show a modal window pop up that provides some deeper info for you such as their cell number, address and date of birth. I have also added functionality to move between modal windows with
next and previous buttons as well as search functionality to search through the employees displayed on the page.

For the style change, in the .modal-button-container class, I removed the border. This makes the modal window look much cleaner. Before I removed it, there was a black border around
the next and previous buttons. Now, there is no border giving it a much cleaner look (in my oppinion).

I also adjusted the border-radius of the search-input and search-input:hover so that regularly (while not hovering) it's 50% and on hover, it goes to 0%. I thought this was kind of unique looking.

Lastly, I changed the background color for .card:hover to a pinkish red to stand out a little more and add some flare.
